# INTERNSHALA ASSIGNMENT



Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.

Using the following:

1. Django,
2. file-based SQLite
3. Data given at link:  [https://python-exercise.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/restaurants_small.csv](https://python-exercise.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/restaurants_small.csv)
   Design an admin-template based Django search application that can search through the names of dishes and recommend the best match for the same.

You need to submit {all three of them compulsorily):

1. Working code with requirements.txt
2. Working SQLite db file.
3. An screenshot of the working app with a search query and its results. Assignment won't be evaluated if screenshot is not present.

You may upload your code and both the files in a zip file here OR on GitHub, google drive, or any other repository. Make sure we can read your code.
All three files are a must to move further.

Thanks,
Sandeepan

Submission deadline: 15 July, 2024
